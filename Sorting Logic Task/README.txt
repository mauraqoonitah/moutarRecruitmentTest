Quick Sort Algorithm:
Select middle element as pivot, 
find element which is greater than pivot,
find element which is smaller than pivot,
if we found the element on the left side which is greater than pivot and element on the right side which is smaller than pivot: Swap them, and increase the left and right
and then Recursion on left and right of the pivot to get the sorted array
